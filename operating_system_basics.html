  <h1>Operating System</h1>
  <pre>
    * operating system is an interface between user and computer hardware.
      user --> application program --> operating system (kernel) --> hardware (c.p.u.) , (r.a.m.) , (i/o) , etc.
    * operating system is a system software.
    * goals of operating system.
      1. primary = convinience (easy to use). eg. windows
      2. secondary = efficient (fast processing). 
  </pre><hr>

  <h2>How operating system works ?</h2>
  <pre> 
    * shell = interface between user command and kernel which takes input from user and send instruction to kernel.
    * kernel = kernel is the heart of operating system. it access the hardware through user's input .
  </pre><hr>

  <h2>Functions of Operating System</h2>
  <pre>
    1. resource management
       --> hardware
       --> software
    2. memory management
       --> R.A.M. 
    3. i/o management
       --> operating system also manages input and output devices.
    4. storage management
       --> hard disk
    5. process management
       --> schedule process to C.P.U. 
    6. security & protection
       
    NOTE :- memory means R.A.M. and storage means hard disk.
  </pre><hr>

  <h3>What is System Call ?</h3>
  <pre>
    * request made by user program to operating system in order to get any kind of service.
    * user gives an input through any program then the input convert into a sytem calls then it can
      interacts and access with the computer hardware.
    * ex :-
    main()
    {
      int x;
      print f("hello");
    }
    here printf internally called write() system calls in order to communicate monitor.
    * in windows there are approx 700 system calls. 
    <!-- * operating system basiscally works on two mode. 
      1. user mode 2. kernel mode  12.00 -->
  </pre><hr>

  <h2>Types of Operating System</h2>
  <pre>
    1. batch operating system
       * In batch os, one job or task runs or execute at a time in many jobs or tasks present in R.A.M.
         with operating system.
       * Then that running job go to the C.P.U. for execution and spend its C.P.U. time.
       * Every Job have mainly two time. 
         1. C.P.U. time
         2. I/O time
       * If that running job go to the C.P.U. for execution and if that job demand or need for I/O
         then it goes to the I/O (input-output devices) . 
       * The C.P.U. remains idle or free at that time when job go for the I/O. 
       * If the first task or job is fully completed then the other job or task is scheduled.
       * So, basically batch os gives
         --> less throughput (throughput = number of job completed per unit time).
         --> increase C.P.U. idleness.

     2. multiprogramming operating system
        * In batch os, one job or task runs or execute at a time in many jobs or tasks present in R.A.M.
          with operating system.
        * Then that running job go to the C.P.U. for execution and spend its C.P.U. time.
        * If that running job go to the C.P.U. for execution and if that job demand or need for I/O
          then it goes to the I/O (input-output devices) . 
        * While the first job is going for the I/O C.P.U. time doesn't became idle or free.
        * In multiprogramming operating system, another job or task execute to the C.P.U. 
          when the first job is going for the I/O.
                  
     3. multitasking operating system
        * extension(evolved version ) of multiprogramming operating system.
        * In multitasking operating system, jobs or tasks execuded in time sharing mode. 

     4. multiprocessor operating system (parallel system)
        * more than one processor or C.P.U. is present, so many jobs can be executed at a single time,
          thats why it is also known as parallel system.
        * it is a fault tolerant system, if one C.P.U. fails then other C.P.U. continues the work.

     5. real time operating system
        * This system is strictly time-bound.
        * It is of two type 
          1. Hard real time system. eg. missile system, satellite system.
          2. Soft real time system. eg. banking system.
